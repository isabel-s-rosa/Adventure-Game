# I Adventure Game
This program runs on Greenfoot.
If you have Greenfoot, you can open it with that and hit act to play.
Otherwise, download the .jar file.
Then, find the Terminal app on your computer and type "ls" to get a list of directories.
Then, type "cd directory", except replace the word "directory" with the directory you downloaded the .jar file to.
Open the .jar file and the game should work.
